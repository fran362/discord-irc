# discord-irc [![Build status](https://ci.frigg.io/badges/reactiflux/discord-irc/)](https://ci.frigg.io/reactiflux/discord-irc/last/) [![Coverage status](https://ci.frigg.io/badges/coverage/reactiflux/discord-irc/)](https://ci.frigg.io/reactiflux/discord-irc/last/)

> Connects [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) and IRC channels by sending messages back and forth.

A mostly feature complete port of [slack-irc](https://github.com/ekmartin/slack-irc).

## Example

## Installation and usage
Either by installing through npm:
```bash
$ npm install -g discord-irc
$ discord-irc --config /path/to/config.json
```

or by cloning the repository:

```bash
In the repository folder:
$ npm install
$ npm run build # Transpile ES6 to ES5 using Babel
$ npm start -- --config /path/to/config.json # Note the extra double dash
```

It can also be used as a module:
```js
import discordIRC from 'discord-irc';
import config from './config.json';
discordIRC(config);
```

## Configuration
Create a discord user and join the server you want to connect to IRC.

### Example configuration
```js
[
  // Bot 1 (minimal configuration):
  {
    "nickname": "test2",
    "server": "irc.testbot.org",
    "discordEmail": "user@mail.com",
    "discordPassword": "letmein123",
    "channelMapping": {
      "#other-discord": "#new-irc-channel"
    }
  },

  // Bot 2 (advanced options):
  {
    "nickname": "test",
    "server": "irc.bottest.org",
    "discordEmail": "user@mail.com",
    "discordPassword": "letmein123",
    "autoSendCommands": [ // Commands that will be sent on connect
      ["PRIVMSG", "NickServ", "IDENTIFY password"],
      ["MODE", "test", "+x"],
      ["AUTH", "test", "password"]
    ],
    "channelMapping": { // Maps each Discord-channel to an IRC-channel, used to direct messages to the correct place
      "#discord": "#irc channel-password" // Add channel keys after the channel name
    },
    "ircOptions": { // Optional node-irc options
      "floodProtection": false, // On by default
      "floodProtectionDelay": 1000 // 500 by default
    },
    "ircNickColor": false, // Gives usernames a color in IRC for better readability (on by default)
    // Makes the bot hide the username prefix for messages that start
    // with one of these characters (commands):
    "commandCharacters": ["!", "."]
  }
]
```

The `ircOptions` object is passed directly to node-irc ([available options](http://node-irc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/API.html#irc.Client)).

## Tests
Run the tests with:
```bash
$ npm test
```

## Style Guide
discord-irc uses a slightly modified version of the
[Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5).
[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) is used to make sure this is followed correctly, which can be run with:

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

The deviations from the Airbnb Style Guide can be seen in  the [.eslintrc](.eslintrc) file.
